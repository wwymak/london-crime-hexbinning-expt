Basically trying to display london crime data as a hexbinned map, the color of each dot represents the most common crime in that area. Currently the data shows june2015

NEEDS A LEGEND

Crime data from police.uk

TODOS/things to try: 

* hover over a point and it shows a (piechart?) pf the breakdown of distribution of crime in that area

* use a longer time interval

* overlay the hexbin on top of leaflet (?) allow zooming and panning

* show more time intervals/ try to use node(?) or something to hexbin the data server side (?) currently it's massive just for 1 month...
